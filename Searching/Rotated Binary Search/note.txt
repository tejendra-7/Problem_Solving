Let's take an array [3,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]

here we need to search the element in this array firstly we need to find the pivot point which
is the index position where the array is changing from ascending to descending this occurs only once in the array.

here there is only one posiiton where the array is having that next index value lower than the present index value.
That present index value is the pivot point.
